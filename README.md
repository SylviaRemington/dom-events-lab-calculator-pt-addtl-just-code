____________________________________________________________________________________

Introduction:
This lab is to practice interactivity with the webpage and the user through DOM, DOM Event Listeners, DOM manipulation, using Functions, Loops, and Arrays to create an active, interactive calculator... .............. drum rolllllll, please.....

First area I worked on was "Cached Element References" to select elements 
I was going to work on and with which I was going to create Event Listeners.

Additional Idea to customize calculator's for each user using the calculator:

I'd like to initially have the user upload their own personal image (it can be anything that they like) to the body of the calculator so that it can be the background of the calculator, while they solve problems.

Maybe create something so that after each time they add two numbers and solve a problem, they get to go to the "next level" of the calculator and have a different image show up.

When I figure out how to do that, that will be dope!!!! Yay! 


Another idea: add alphabet to the calculator like how phones are... Oh create a phone calculator!
